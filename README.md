# android-app-travels

Your companion for getting around Singapore's MRT system! This application shows you when your train is arriving allows you to plan your commute more wisely!

This Android application (SDK 26 or higher) uses the Land Transport Authority's API and SMRT's train arrivals website to display data.

# Arrival Times

Get train arrival times from across the island! Lines that are supported are:

- North-South Line
- East-West Line (including the Changi Airport Branch)
- Circle Line
- Thomson East-Coast Line

However, do understand that this functionality is highly buggy as of yet. 

## Train Disruptions

This feature allows you to know when a line has encountered a disruption, and also shows the shuttle or bus services available to connect you to your destination!

# Traffic Incidents

Sometimes, it is *on your way to the station* that delays your travel significantly. Thus, by displaying the traffic incidents which include accidents, roadworks and more, you can plan an alternative route!

# Coming soon...

## Bus arrival times

What is a travel application when it doesn't show arrival times for buses? Trust us, we will roll this update out soon!

## Search function

With more than 100 stations, searching a particular station will definitely be challenging. This will be a major quality of life improvement, so look out for it!

# Acknowledgements

We would like to thank LTA for releasing their highly useful API, and to SMRT for their train arrivals website so we can scrape data from there. 

Also, thanks to Google for Kotlin, we can tell the benefits from the switch from Java!
